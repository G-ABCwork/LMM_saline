# RCT of Plasma solution A vs Normal saline
* Key method
  + Linear mixed-models
    + To compare the effects of Plasma solution A and Normal saline on post-cardiac arrest patients
    + Randomized clinical design
    + Data is repeated measured and there are some missing values
  + Logistic regression, Ordinal logistic regression (proportional odds models)
    + To estimate the odds(e.g. change of PH, HCO3, Cl, etc) on Plasma solution A vs Normal saline
    + Doing logistic regression for binary outcomes
    + Doing Ordinal logistic regression(OLR) for continuous outcome 
    + Before OLR, I tested parallel regression assumption with Brant test)
